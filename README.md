# native-chat-app

## Overview

This is a personal project of mine built to learn how React Native and Firebase work. This is a messaging app which users must sign up and log in using email, they can then add friends via email address and then send and receive messages from their friends.

This is the Frontend of the app which is all of the code that allows you to see and interact with the app. The app is built with the React Native framework coupled with React Navigation which allows a multi-page app. You can find the components for the different pages in /screens.

## In progress

Nothing in progress currently. Next thing to be developed is for messages being able to be swiped which will then reveal a date/time of message being sent

## running the app

If you would like to clone the repo and run the app locally on your machine you need to run `yarn install` in your terminal. To run the app on an xcode iphone simulator run the ``yarn ios` command in your terminal. To run on other simulators please refer to the expo docs.

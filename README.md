# native-chat-app

## Overview

This is a personal project of mine built to learn how React Native and Firebase work. This is a messaging app which users must sign up and log in using email, they can then add friends via email address and then send and receive messages from their friends.

This is the Frontend of the app which is all of the code that allows you to see and interact with the app. The app is built with the React Native framework coupled with React Navigation which allows a multi-page app. You can find the components for the different pages in /screens.
